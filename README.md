- 👋 Hi, I’m @derry43 (Derry Birse)
- 👀 I’m interested in GLPI and GLPI plugins
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use GitHub and support development of these projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on existing GLPI and GLPI projects as well as develop a few plugins for which I have some ideas (infra, application, process risk assessment/audit, AD/ldap account/group management (manage staff AD accounts and group memberships directly from GLPI with request/approval workflows), backup process design/record.
- 📫 How to reach me, TBD
